# 🚀 Multi-Agentic AI–Based Business Consulting System

## 📌 Overview

The **Multi-Agentic AI–Based Business Consulting System** is an intelligent, multi-agent architecture designed to **analyze companies, generate AI/ML/GenAI use cases, and support data-driven business consulting decisions**.

The system leverages **LLM-powered autonomous agents**, external data sources (web search, financial data, Kaggle, GitHub, Hugging Face), and orchestration logic to simulate how a **real-world AI consulting team** would operate.

This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI systems** can collaboratively reason, research, synthesize insights, and propose actionable solutions for organizations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a **multi-agent AI system** capable of autonomous collaboration.
* Perform **company-level research** using real-world data sources.
* Generate **AI/ML/GenAI use cases** tailored to business problems.
* Demonstrate **agent orchestration and task decomposition**.
* Showcase production-style **LLM integration with tools**.
* Provide a foundation for **AI-based consulting automation**.
